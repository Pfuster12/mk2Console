# Welcome to the mkII Console
The Mark-II Console is a small console viewport that sits in the corner of your window. Print out your log messages during development with rich formatting and colour, so you don't need to open the hefty developer tools if all you need is to log some stuff out!

Close at any time, no questions asked.

# Themes
The mk2Consoles duty is to bring you beautiful and rich theming for all your logging needs.

Keep it simple with the clean, classic default theme or choose from plugin themes. Or create your own!
